    "text": "1. What is Re Protocol?\nThe Re Protocol is a decentralized platform that leverages reinsurance contracts to generate yield on staked capital. It allows users to deposit stablecoins—such as USDC, DAI, USDe, and sUSDe—into Insurance Capital Layers (ICL). These ICLs allocate capital to fully‑collateralized quota‑share reinsurance contracts through licensed insurers. Depending on your strategy, earn stablecoin yield generated from premiums or delta‑neutral market strategies, depending on the selected ICL.\n2. What Tokens Can I Deposit?\nEthena tokens: USDe, sUSDe\nTraditional stablecoins: USDC, AUSD, DAI, and others\nVisit the staking section of our app for the most up-to-date accepted assets.\nhttps://app.re.xyz/reusd\nor\nhttps://app.re.xyz/reusde\n3. What are reUSDe vs. reUSD?\nFeature\nreUSDe (Insurance Alpha)\nreUSD (Basis‑Plus )\nAccepted Collateral\nUSDe, sUSDe\nUSDC, DAI, USDe/sUSDe\nStrategy\nIdle USDe converted to sUSDe, earning Ethena’s yield\nIdle assets deployed into delta-neutral ETH basis or short-duration T-bills with a protocol spread\nYield Goal\nHigh underwriting yields (15 %–23 % APY)\nLow-volatility yields (6 %–10% APY)\nIdeal For\nEthena community wanting high yield via reinsurance\nStablecoin holders seeking steady income without underwriting exposure\n4. How Do I Deposit?\nConnect your wallet (e.g., MetaMask)\nComplete KYC/AML verification\nSelect your strategy: choose reUSDe or reUSD ICL\nDeposit assets and receive corresponding tokens\n5. When Will I Earn Yield?\nreUSDe (Insurance Alpha): Funds are deployed into reinsurance programs, earning premium-driven yields—typically 15%–23 % APY.\nreUSD (Basis‑Plus): Assets earn yield immediately via delta-neutral ETH strategy or T-bills plus protocol spread—approximately 6 %–9+ % APY.\n7. How is Risk Managed?\nAll ICLs participate in fully collateralized quota-share reinsurance notes backed by licensed insurance companies. All collateral is on-chain and held in trust accounts. All funds are protected with transparent, on-chain reporting.\nOnce available, all offchain accounts will be reported via Chainlink and verified by a third party.\nAll transactions are managed through an MCP with multi party signatures required for each transaction.\n8. Who Is Eligible?\nGlobal access (excluding participants from the U.S. and other restricted jurisdictions)\nKYC/AML is mandatory\nRestricted countries include (but are not limited to): U.S., Iran, North Korea, Syria, Russia, Belarus, Cuba, and others as listed in our policy.\n9. How Do Redemptions Work?\nreUSDe: Once collateral is no longer required , redemptions are executed during quarterly windows. Redemption entitles you to principal + underwriting yield in stablecoins. Until redemption windows open, the protocol will support liquidity through liquidity pools. The initial liquidity pool has been seeded on Curve and available at the following :\nhttps://www.curve.finance/dex/ethereum/pools/factory-twocrypto-169/swap/\nreUSD: While reUSD will be more liquid and not technically on risk, the protocol will maintain liquidity through a curve pool similarly to reUSDe until redemption windows become possible.\nhttps://www.curve.finance/dex/ethereum/pools/factory-stable-ng-466/swap/\nWhen available, reUSD will be redeemable up until available liquidity has been exhausted\nRedemptions will then fall back to quarterly redemption windows until liquidity is replaced.\n10. What If My KYC Fails?\nFunds remain securely in escrow.\nContact our support:\n[email protected]\nWe typically respond within 2–3 business days to resolve issues or initiate refunds.\n11. How Is Token Price Updated?\nAt UTC 00:00 daily, the protocol recalculates the Net Asset Value (NAV) of reUSDe and reUSD, reflecting both realized and projected yields.\nreUSDe: NAV reflects underwriting yield from reinsurance contracts.\nreUSD: NAV factors in projected earnings from delta-neutral trades and T-bills.\nYou can view daily NAV updates and yield breakdowns at\nre.xyz\nDirect Access to Current yield and price :\nhttps://api.re.xyz/apy/get-apy\n12. Why can't I see the tokens in my wallet ?\nIf you cannot see the tokens in your wallet, it means that you need to add the token address.\nFor reUSD :\nEthereum :\n0x5086bf358635B81D8C47C66d1C8b9E567Db70c72\nAvalanche :\n0x180aF87b47Bf272B2df59dccf2D76a6eaFa625Bf\nArbitrum :\n0x76cE01F0Ef25AA66cC5F1E546a005e4A63B25609\nFor reUSDe :\nEthereum :\n0xdDC0f880ff6e4e22E4B74632fBb43Ce4DF6cCC5a\nNext\nQuickStart Guide\nLast updated\n3 months ago"

    "text": "The Re Protocol is a groundbreaking innovation that bridges the gap between traditional insurance markets and decentralized finance (DeFi). Built on blockchain technology, Re Protocol introduces an unprecedented level of transparency, efficiency, and accessibility to the global reinsurance market. A multi-trillion-dollar industry historically characterized by opacity and reliance on intermediaries.\nAt its core, Re Protocol facilitates direct, efficient capital allocation to reinsurance contracts. This is achieved through a network of interconnected smart contracts and an architecture designed for auditable, secure operations. Participants in the protocol gain exposure to the returns of the reinsurance sector without the traditional barriers of entry, while simultaneously benefiting from the transparency and automation enabled by blockchain.\nDeposited assets sweep daily to a Fireblocks vault. When the licensed reinsurer draws on a Surplus Note, collateral moves on‑chain to the contracting reinsurance counterparty.\nAll assets moved into a reinsurance contract or off ramped into a regulated 114 trust bank account will be reported on chain via third party verification and reported on chainlink.\nWhen sufficient capital is raised between the reUSD and reUSDe ICLs, the protocol will sign binding surplus note agreements with an approved reinsurance entity.\nreUSD will be available to the reinsurance company to provide regulatory backing while reUSDe will be used to pay any sort of losses and provide a back stop to prevent any risk to reUSD.\nAs reinsurance contracts mature, the actuary reinsurance team will determine available funds to be released. As funds are released and paid back to the Re Protocol, liquidity and redemptions will be supported for reUSD and underwriting margin will be paid in profits back to reUSDe supporting its increase in price.\nKey Features:\nTokenized Access to Reinsurance:\nBy issuing reUSD and reUSDe tokens, Re Protocol provides a simple yet powerful way to participate in reinsurance-backed contracts. These tokens reflect the value of the underlying insurance capital and its returns.\nTwo Ways to Participate\nInsurance Alpha (reUSDe) – capture the 15-23 % underwriting spread from real U.S. insurance programs.\nBasis-Plus (reUSD) – park capital in a low-volatility T-bill + spread vault (≈ 6-9+ % net).\nParticipants in either track receive the same economic exposure, letting you choose your preferred risk/return profile without differential incentives.\nStrategic Partnerships:\nRe Protocol begins its journey in partnership with CoverRe.com, an established Cayman-based reinsurer. This ensures stability and operational expertise during the protocol’s initial phase.\nGradual Decentralization:\nWhile initially governed by a centralized council of experts, Re Protocol is designed to transition into a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to empower community-driven decision-making.\nBy combining the strengths of blockchain technology with the stability of the reinsurance market, Re Protocol is positioned to redefine the way capital is deployed and managed in the insurance industry.\nPrevious\nQuickStart Guide\nNext\nConnect with Us\nLast updated\n4 months ago"

    "text": "reUSD ( Basis - Plus )\nTL;DR\nreUSD is a principal‑protected, yield‑accruing token that tracks the greater of (i) the risk‑free rate\nplus 250 bps\nor (ii) the Ethena basis‑trade yield\nplus 250 bps\n. It earns on‑chain, deploys off‑chain via Surplus Notes to supply regulatory capital, and maintains transparent, oracle‑verified collateral reporting.\n1. Purpose & Positioning\nreUSD is designed as the\n“stable core”\nof the Re Protocol. Holders receive a low‑volatility, USD‑denominated asset that:\npreserves principal at all times;\nautomatically accrues yield daily; and\nremains redeemable, subject to actuarially‑defined liquidity limits, for the underlying admitted assets (e.g., USDC, T‑Bills).\nThis makes reUSD analogous to a tokenized money‑market fund with the added flexibility of blockchain composability and real‑world reinsurance yield capture.\n2. Yield Mechanism\n2.1 Dual‑Source Yield Floor\nAt each daily valuation point, the protocol selects the higher of the following reference rates:\nSource\nFormula\nNotes\nRisk‑Free Rate Path\n7‑day trailing average Risk Free Rate +\n250 bps\nProvides a predictable floor aligned with short‑term Treasuries.\nEthena Basis Trade Path\nCurrent annualized yield reported by Ethena (USDe hedged basis)\nplus 250 bps\nCaptures excess basis when the futures curve is steep.\n2.2 Daily APY & Price Update\nThe chosen “Applicable APY” is converted to a\ndaily rate.\nreUSD’s\ntoken price\n(rather than token quantity) increases every UTC day at 00:00.\nA JSON price feed is pushed on‑chain via Chainlink, enabling DeFi integrations and transparent compounding.\n3. Capital Deployment via Surplus Notes\nOn‑Chain Staking\n: Users mint reUSD by depositing admitted assets into the Insurance Capital Layer (ICL).\nOff‑Ramp to 114 Trust\n: The protocol converts a portion of the pool into cash/T‑Bills held in a §114 Reinsurance Trust Account, providing regulatory collateral to partner reinsurers.\nSurplus Notes\n: The off‑chain entity issues surplus notes to the ICL, contractually locking in principal protection and an interest rate matching the Applicable APY.\nCustody & Visibility\n: All trust assets are held with an independent bank/custodian. Balances are reported daily by a third‑party administrator and published through a Chainlink oracle.\n4. Liquidity & Redemption Framework\nTier\nCapacity\nSettlement Speed\nSource of Funds\nInstant “Smooth‑Buffer”\nUp to an\nactuarially determined\nbuffer (e.g., 10 % of NAV)\ninstant\nIdle on‑chain liquidity + cash sweep\nScheduled Window\nOnce buffer is exhausted\nMonthly\nredemption window (e.g., 1st business day)\nMatured trust assets + surplus‑note repayments\nRe‑Liquidity\nAs actuarial releases occur\nContinuous top‑up of buffer\nActuary authorizes transfer of released collateral back on‑chain\n5. Transparency & Risk Controls\nChainlink Feeds\n: Real‑time NAV, buffer utilization, surplus‑note balances.\nFireblocks Custody\n: Multisig policies governing idle on‑chain assets.\nAudit Trail\n: Smart‑contract audits and third party verified‑qualified trust reporting.\nNo Redemption Gating Tokens\n: Price increases accrue to\nall\nholders.\n6. Key Advantages vs. TradFi Alternatives\nYield > Money‑Market Funds\n: By dynamically switching to the basis trade when advantageous, reUSD often outperforms pure T‑Bill strategies.\nRegulatory Capital Utility\n: Surplus Note structure channels DeFi liquidity into highly secure (NAIC‑compliant) reinsurance collateral.\nOn‑Chain Composability\n: Compatible with Curve, Pendle, and Morpho for secondary yield opportunities.\nPrincipal Protection\n: Surplus note rank and segregated trust accounts shield depositor principal from operating losses.\n7.

    "text": "Reinsurance, often referred to as \"insurance for insurance companies,\" is a financial mechanism that plays a critical role in stabilizing and strengthening the global insurance ecosystem. At its core, reinsurance is a contract in which one insurance company (the cedent) transfers part or all of its risk portfolio to another insurance entity (the reinsurer). This transfer allows insurance companies to mitigate exposure to large losses, stabilize their balance sheets, and continue to underwrite policies without interruption.\nA Brief History of Reinsurance\nThe concept of reinsurance can be traced back several centuries, with early forms emerging in maritime insurance during the 14th century in Genoa and other trading hubs. These agreements were designed to spread the risk of cargo losses during long and perilous sea voyages. Over time, as economies and industries expanded, the reinsurance industry evolved to cover more diverse and complex risks, including property, casualty, life, and health insurance.\nBy the 19th century, reinsurance became formalized with the establishment of dedicated reinsurance companies such as Munich Re in 1880 and Swiss Re in 1863. These entities pioneered modern reinsurance practices, offering innovative risk-sharing solutions to insurers worldwide. Today, the industry encompasses a broad range of risk management strategies, including proportional and non-proportional treaties, facultative agreements, and collateralized reinsurance.\nThe Role of Reinsurance Today\nIn the 21st century, reinsurance has become indispensable for managing the risks associated with natural disasters, pandemics, and other large-scale events. It enables insurance companies to:\nDiversify Risk:\nBy transferring portions of their portfolios to reinsurers, cedents can reduce their exposure to concentrated risks, such as catastrophic weather events or high-value property claims.\nEnhance Capital Efficiency:\nReinsurance allows insurers to free up capital, enabling them to underwrite more policies and grow their businesses.\nStabilize Loss Ratios:\nReinsurers absorb losses from extraordinary events, reducing volatility in the financial performance of cedents.\nChallenges in the Current Reinsurance Industry\nWhile reinsurance remains a cornerstone of global risk management, the industry faces challenges such as limited transparency, reliance on intermediaries, and high barriers to entry for capital providers. These issues have created inefficiencies that restrict the flow of capital and hinder innovation. Re Protocol seeks to address these challenges by introducing a decentralized framework that enhances transparency, efficiency, and access.\nReinsurance is not just a financial tool; it is a fundamental component of societal resilience, enabling communities and economies to recover quickly from unforeseen events. By leveraging blockchain technology, the Re Protocol is poised to transform how capital flows into this essential industry, creating new opportunities for insurers and investors alike.\nPrevious\nWhat is reUSDe ?\nNext\nHow Collateralized Reinsurance Earns Returns\nLast updated\n11 months ago"

By doing so, capital providers assume risk in exchange for a premium, which becomes their profit after claims are paid and obligations are met.\nRe Protocol’s Focus\nInitially, the Re Protocol will focus exclusively on backing non-catastrophic, low-volatility, and short-duration program business. This conservative approach ensures stable returns and mitigates high-risk exposure. These programs generally include:\nAutomobile insurance portfolios\nCommercial general liability coverage\nProperty insurance with limited catastrophic exposure\nProfit Timeline\nCollateral Release: Reinsurance programs typically start releasing collateral back to the protocol after 18 months.\nProfit Realization: As collateral is released, Risk Pools begin to pay out profits to the protocol and its participants.\nSteady Returns: This timeline provides predictable cash flows, ensuring reUSD and reUSDe holders benefit from consistent, transparent earnings.\nBy leveraging this model, the Re Protocol offers participants access to a secure and stable revenue stream, while maintaining robust protections against high-impact events.\nPrevious\nWhat is Reinsurance?\nNext\nInvestor Protections and Risk Management\nLast updated\n4 months ago"

By leveraging blockchain technology and industry best practices, the protocol minimizes risk exposure and maximizes transparency.\nCore Investor Protections\nFully Collateralized Funds:\nAll assets in the Insurance Capital Layer (ICL) are fully collateralized, ensuring that claims and obligations can be met promptly and reliably.\nSegregated Accounts:\nFunds are held in segregated accounts separated by risk type, preventing commingling of assets and maintaining clear financial accountability.\nIndependent Audits:\nRegular third-party audits are conducted to ensure the security, integrity, and compliance of the protocol. These audits include detailed reviews of smart contracts and financial operations.\nTransparent Reporting:\nAll transactions, asset holdings, and performance metrics are recorded on-chain, allowing participants to verify data in real time through the protocol’s dashboard.\nComprehensive Risk Management Strategies\nConservative Contract Focus:\nInitially, the protocol prioritizes non-catastrophic, low-volatility, short-duration program business to ensure predictable and stable returns.\nRigorous Vetting of Cell Managers:\nCell Managers undergo a thorough Know Your Business (KYB) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) screening process before being approved to manage Risk Pools.\nCollateralized Risk Pools:\nAll Risk Pools are fully collateralized to mitigate counterparty risk and ensure that capital is available to cover claims.\nControlled Growth:\nThe protocol carefully scales operations, onboarding new Cell Managers and expanding Risk Pools only when governance structures and operational capacity can support growth.\nEmergency Protections\nPause Mechanism:\nIn the event of a security breach or other emergency, the protocol includes a mechanism to immediately pause operations and safeguard funds. Assets can be transferred to recovery wallets as a precautionary measure.\nRecovery Wallets:\nEach Insurance Capital Layer has its own designated recovery wallet for secure storage during emergencies. For example, the recovery wallet for the initial ICL is: 0xDf6bF2713b5c7CA724E684657280bC407938F447.\nGovernance Oversight\nExpert-Led Council:\nDuring its initial phase, the protocol is governed by a council of industry and DeFi experts who oversee capital allocation, risk management, and participant protections.\nTransition to Decentralization:\nAs the protocol matures, governance will transition to a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), empowering participants to play an active role in decision-making.\nBy embedding these protections and risk management practices into its design, the Re Protocol ensures that participant funds are safeguarded and that the platform remains resilient and transparent.

    "text": "1. What is Re Protocol?\nThe Re Protocol is a decentralized platform that leverages reinsurance contracts to generate yield on staked capital. It allows users to deposit stablecoins—such as USDC, DAI, USDe, and sUSDe—into Insurance Capital Layers (ICL). These ICLs allocate capital to fully‑collateralized quota‑share reinsurance contracts through licensed insurers. Depending on your strategy, earn stablecoin yield generated from premiums or delta‑neutral market strategies, depending on the selected ICL.\n2. What Tokens Can I Deposit?\nEthena tokens: USDe, sUSDe\nTraditional stablecoins: USDC, AUSD, DAI, and others\nVisit the staking section of our app for the most up-to-date accepted assets.\nhttps://app.re.xyz/reusd\nor\nhttps://app.re.xyz/reusde\n3. What are reUSDe vs. reUSD?\nFeature\nreUSDe (Insurance Alpha)\nreUSD (Basis‑Plus )\nAccepted Collateral\nUSDe, sUSDe\nUSDC, DAI, USDe/sUSDe\nStrategy\nIdle USDe converted to sUSDe, earning Ethena’s yield\nIdle assets deployed into delta-neutral ETH basis or short-duration T-bills with a protocol spread\nYield Goal\nHigh underwriting yields (15 %–23 % APY)\nLow-volatility yields (6 %–10% APY)\nIdeal For\nEthena community wanting high yield via reinsurance\nStablecoin holders seeking steady income without underwriting exposure\n4. How Do I Deposit?\nConnect your wallet (e.g., MetaMask)\nComplete KYC/AML verification\nSelect your strategy: choose reUSDe or reUSD ICL\nDeposit assets and receive corresponding tokens\n5. When Will I Earn Yield?\nreUSDe (Insurance Alpha): Funds are deployed into reinsurance programs, earning premium-driven yields—typically 15%–23 % APY.\nreUSD (Basis‑Plus): Assets earn yield immediately via delta-neutral ETH strategy or T-bills plus protocol spread—approximately 6 %–9+ % APY.\n7. How is Risk Managed?\nAll ICLs participate in fully collateralized quota-share reinsurance notes backed by licensed insurance companies. All collateral is on-chain and held in trust accounts. All funds are protected with transparent, on-chain reporting.\nOnce available, all offchain accounts will be reported via Chainlink and verified by a third party.\nAll transactions are managed through an MCP with multi party signatures required for each transaction.\n8. Who Is Eligible?\nGlobal access (excluding participants from the U.S. and other restricted jurisdictions)\nKYC/AML is mandatory\nRestricted countries include (but are not limited to): U.S., Iran, North Korea, Syria, Russia, Belarus, Cuba, and others as listed in our policy.\n9. How Do Redemptions Work?\nreUSDe: Once collateral is no longer required , redemptions are executed during quarterly windows. Redemption entitles you to principal + underwriting yield in stablecoins. Until redemption windows open, the protocol will support liquidity through liquidity pools. The initial liquidity pool has been seeded on Curve and available at the following :\nhttps://www.curve.finance/dex/ethereum/pools/factory-twocrypto-169/swap/\nreUSD: While reUSD will be more liquid and not technically on risk, the protocol will maintain liquidity through a curve pool similarly to reUSDe until redemption windows become possible.\nhttps://www.curve.finance/dex/ethereum/pools/factory-stable-ng-466/swap/\nWhen available, reUSD will be redeemable up until available liquidity has been exhausted\nRedemptions will then fall back to quarterly redemption windows until liquidity is replaced.\n10. What If My KYC Fails?\nFunds remain securely in escrow.\nContact our support:\n[email protected]\nWe typically respond within 2–3 business days to resolve issues or initiate refunds.\n11. How Is Token Price Updated?\nAt UTC 00:00 daily, the protocol recalculates the Net Asset Value (NAV) of reUSDe and reUSD, reflecting both realized and projected yields.\nreUSDe: NAV reflects underwriting yield from reinsurance contracts.\nreUSD: NAV factors in projected earnings from delta-neutral trades and T-bills.\nYou can view daily NAV updates and yield breakdowns at\nre.xyz\nDirect Access to Current yield and price :\nhttps://api.re.xyz/apy/get-apy\n12. Why can't I see the tokens in my wallet ?\nIf you cannot see the tokens in your wallet, it means that you need to add the token address.\nFor reUSD :\nEthereum :\n0x5086bf358635B81D8C47C66d1C8b9E567Db70c72\nAvalanche :\n0x180aF87b47Bf272B2df59dccf2D76a6eaFa625Bf\nArbitrum :\n0x76cE01F0Ef25AA66cC5F1E546a005e4A63B25609\nFor reUSDe :\nEthereum :\n0xdDC0f880ff6e4e22E4B74632fBb43Ce4DF6cCC5a\nNext\nQuickStart Guide\nLast updated\n3 months ago"

    "text": "Reinsurance, often referred to as \"insurance for insurance companies,\" is a financial mechanism that plays a critical role in stabilizing and strengthening the global insurance ecosystem. At its core, reinsurance is a contract in which one insurance company (the cedent) transfers part or all of its risk portfolio to another insurance entity (the reinsurer). This transfer allows insurance companies to mitigate exposure to large losses, stabilize their balance sheets, and continue to underwrite policies without interruption.\nA Brief History of Reinsurance\nThe concept of reinsurance can be traced back several centuries, with early forms emerging in maritime insurance during the 14th century in Genoa and other trading hubs. These agreements were designed to spread the risk of cargo losses during long and perilous sea voyages. Over time, as economies and industries expanded, the reinsurance industry evolved to cover more diverse and complex risks, including property, casualty, life, and health insurance.\nBy the 19th century, reinsurance became formalized with the establishment of dedicated reinsurance companies such as Munich Re in 1880 and Swiss Re in 1863. These entities pioneered modern reinsurance practices, offering innovative risk-sharing solutions to insurers worldwide. Today, the industry encompasses a broad range of risk management strategies, including proportional and non-proportional treaties, facultative agreements, and collateralized reinsurance.\nThe Role of Reinsurance Today\nIn the 21st century, reinsurance has become indispensable for managing the risks associated with natural disasters, pandemics, and other large-scale events. It enables insurance companies to:\nDiversify Risk:\nBy transferring portions of their portfolios to reinsurers, cedents can reduce their exposure to concentrated risks, such as catastrophic weather events or high-value property claims.\nEnhance Capital Efficiency:\nReinsurance allows insurers to free up capital, enabling them to underwrite more policies and grow their businesses.\nStabilize Loss Ratios:\nReinsurers absorb losses from extraordinary events, reducing volatility in the financial performance of cedents.\nChallenges in the Current Reinsurance Industry\nWhile reinsurance remains a cornerstone of global risk management, the industry faces challenges such as limited transparency, reliance on intermediaries, and high barriers to entry for capital providers. These issues have created inefficiencies that restrict the flow of capital and hinder innovation. Re Protocol seeks to address these challenges by introducing a decentralized framework that enhances transparency, efficiency, and access.\nReinsurance is not just a financial tool; it is a fundamental component of societal resilience, enabling communities and economies to recover quickly from unforeseen events. By leveraging blockchain technology, the Re Protocol is poised to transform how capital flows into this essential industry, creating new opportunities for insurers and investors alike.\nPrevious\nWhat is reUSDe ?\nNext\nHow Collateralized Reinsurance Earns Returns\nLast updated\n11 months ago"
